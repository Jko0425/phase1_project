# What Drives a Film's Profit Margin?

## Overview
Movie studios often take risks when it comes to funding something new or different. This project can help minimize Microsoft's risks. The data shows that ratings and cast/crew members may contribute increasing profit margins. However, a renown cast/crew may result in a high production budget, which may deter investors. If less capital is invested, the studio may need to shift genres in order to maximize their return. The studio may use the findings from this project to aid their decision process.

## Business Problem
There are many variables that affect a movie's ROI (e.g. if the movie is part of a series/universe, or the notoriety of a cast member). Some of these variables may be difficult to measure. Therefore, quantitative data, such as `ratings`, `cast/crew members`, and `genres`, will be investigated. By analyzing the data provided, a company like Microsoft will be able use these results to determine what type of movie to invest in.

## Data
A conglomerate of data from different databases is used in this project. The names of the cast/crew and ratings is provided by [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/), whereas the data for budget and gross is provided by [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/). The data for ratings and vote count from IMDB was substituted in for the missing data provided by [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US).
